            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              I’m a full-stack developer who’s passionate about making things that help people create without all the stress. I know firsthand how overwhelming it can be to manage content, SEO, and everything else when you’re just trying to run a business or blog.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              That’s why I created this tool  to help you generate high-quality blog posts, fast. I wanted to make something that anyone could use, whether you’re a business owner, freelancer, or someone who just doesn’t have time to write every day.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              This whole thing is built by me from the idea to the code, and I’m really proud of how it’s turned out. I hope it helps you take your content game to the next level.

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              I built this because I saw a gap  there are plenty of tools that claim to make content easier, but most are either too complex or just don&apos;t get the tone right. Here’s what I aimed for with this tool:
            </p>
            <ul className="space-y-4 list-disc list-inside text-gray-700">
              <li>💡 Fast, efficient AI that actually understands your brand’s tone and voice.</li>
              <li>🌍 It’s built for people who want personalized, cultural style options (like Moroccan flair) in their content.</li>
              <li>🛠 No complicated setup  just plug it into your WordPress or Shopify and start posting.</li>
              <li>🚀 A streamlined experience that gets out of your way, so you can focus on what matters: running your business.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              At the end of the day, I wanted to build something that I’d want to use myself. And I think that’s reflected in how easy it is to get started and start seeing results.
